          <p> Gold beach was at the centre of the 5 beaches and was invaded by the British 50th infantry division. The beach was more than 8km wide and included the coastal towns of La Rivière
          and Le Hamel. The western end of the beach had a small port called Arromanches. The defending Germans consisted of the 716th division and at least part of the 1st battalion from the 352nd division at Le Hamel.
          The Germans had set up in many houses along the coast with the greatest concentration of them in La Le Hamel and La Rivière. These positions were vulnerable to offshore and aerial bombardments but the Germans counted
          on a counter attack capability of the Kampfgruppe Meyer, a mechanized unit of the 352nd division, who were stationed at Bayeux. The Germans had been rapid responses to the beach incase of an invasion. The Germans also
          had a formidable obsvervation post that was the lookout for and directed fire of four 155mm guns which were set up in the area to fire on the beach.</p>

          <p>Gold beach was assigned to the British 2nd Army under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey. The objectives for the soldiers were to cut the Caen-Bateux highway, take the small port of Arromanches, link up with the Americans
          that came from Omaha at Port-en-Bessin to the west and link up with the Canadians from Juno to the east. 50th division was also tasked with attacking the battery. The British landed an hour later than the americans because of the tides.
          The tide moved from west to east which meant high water came later for the British but the water built up rapidly as the wind was coming from the north west. This meant the outer obstacles the germans made to damage or destroy invading
          landing craft wee covered by water. The first to land were landing craft tanks in which 20 of them were moderatley or severely damaged due to mines.</p></td>

          <p>The British were lucky as the Germans had no armour on the beach and the infantry were largely ineffective and this was due to the offshore bombardments that happened before the landings begun. The british had captured La Rivière 10:00 am and La Hamel
          by mid-afternoon. They also pushed south past Arromanches and managed to get within a Kilometre of Port-en-Bessin. The battery of 155mm guns was destroyed after a furious duel with a Cruiser called HMS Ajax. At nightfall, the British had landed
          25,000 troops, penetrated 10km inland, hooked up witht he Canadians to the east and reached the heights above Port-en-Bessin. They did not manage to cut the Caen-Bayeux highway or meet the Americans from Omaha but still had an impressive start and
          400 casualties while securing the beachhead.</p></td>
