          <p>Carentan was very important to both the allies and the Germans because four major highways and a railroad converged in the City. There was also a second reason why
          Carentan was important to the allies and it was because Carentan was between Omaha and Utah and when captured could link the two beachheads together. The four major highways cmae from Cherbourg,
          Caen and Bayeux, St. Lo and Coutances. It took 6 days of intense fighting to capture Carentan and it was the 101st Airborne paved the way for victory.</p>
