          <p>The British 6th Airborne division was dropped on the left flank of the invasion area to protect it. The objectives of the drop were to
            destroy the bridges across the rivers Dives and Divette in order to prevent the Germans using these bridges during a counter attack. The bridges across the
            Orne and the Canal of Caen, named by the British forces the Horsa Bridge and the Pegasus Bridge respectively, had to be taken intact as these had to be used
            later on by the British forces for the connection between the bridge-head of the airborne troops and Sword Beach. Apart from that, the Merville Battery had to
            be demolished before the landings on Sword Beach would begin, as those could direct their fire at the invasion troops on Sword Beach.</p>

          <p>The actions of the 6th Airborne Division were carried out by 3rd Parachute Brigade, 5th Parachute Brigade and 6th Airlanding Brigade. The targets of the 3rd
            Parachute Brigade were the demolition of the four bridges over the Dives, one bridge across the Divette at Varaville and to capture the battery at Merville.
            The target of the 5th Parachute Brigade was the intact capturing of the Horsa Bridge and the Pegasus Bridge after which a bridge-head had to be established to
            defend both. The 6th Airlanding Brigade would land in the evening of the 6th of June 1944 during Operation Mallard in order to reinforce both parachute brigades.
            The landing of the 3rd Parachute Brigade consisting of the 9th Parachute Battalion, the 8th (Midlands) Parachute Battalion and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion
            did not proceed smoothly as heavy overcast caused navigation problems. The paratroopers of the 8th Parachute Battalion and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion got
            dispersed during the landing but succeeded finally to demolish the bridges at Troarn, Bures, Robbehomme and Varaville. Thereafter they moved in westerly direction in
            order to capture the ridge between Amfreville and Troarn and to fend off German counter attacks in the direction of the bridge-head. The 600 paras of the 9th Parachute
            Battalion were also scattered during the landing. After the troops had left the dropzone they advanced towards this crossroads about 2 kilometres east from the battery.
            Here they were informed by a reconnaissance group of the battalion that had jumped before the main force and had to confirm the German presence in the battery. After they
            had checked their weapons, the 150 men that had come together in time, left for the battery. The paratroopers successfully destroyed their guns but out of the 150 men more
          then half were left dead or wounded.</p></td>

          <p>The most famous achievement of the British airborne troops on D-Day was the capture of Pegasus Bridge, at Benouville on the Orne Canal, and a nearby bridge over the River Orne,
            the only such pair of bridges between Caen and the coast. These two bridges were to be captured by a small force under Major John Howard carried in six Horsa gliders. The first of
            these gliders cast off from its tug craft at just after midnight, followed at one minute intervals by the other five. After 16 mins five of these six gliders landed within a few yards of
            their targets, and within fifteen minutes both bridges had been captured intact. The British plan called for the 7th Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Pine Coffin,
            to join the men at the bridges soon after they were captured, but the paratrooper landings were more scattered than had been expected. Pine Coffin waited as long as he dared at the landing
            zone, before leading his men to the bridges, where they arrived just as the Germans began to counterattack. The next wave of reinforcements was to be provided by Lord Lovat's commandos, but
            they didn't arrive until just after 1pm. Luckily for the airborne troops the nearest German tanks, Colonel Hans von Luck's 125th Regiment of the 21st Panzer Division, were
            not given permission to attack the bridge until 2pm, by which time British tanks had arrived from the coast. The attacks during the morning were made by the existing German of Benouville,
            supported by some obsolete French tanks captured in 1940. Luck's attempted counterattack ended in disaster. His tanks were spotted by Allied aircraft, and were targeted by the large guns of the
            naval force just off the coast. The leading battalion lost thirteen of its seventeen tanks to naval fire, and Luck was forced to go onto the defensive. Pegasus Bridge remained in British hands.</p></td>
