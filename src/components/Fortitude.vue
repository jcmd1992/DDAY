          <p>Operation Fortitude was designed to keep the German spies in england from finding the real location of the invasion. This involved telling neutral countries faking information and deliberately leaking fake information to spies.
          The allies also erected fake bases using fake planes and tanks. When need they would move the fake tanks and make tracks on the ground to fool the spies and planes that the tanks had moved. These fake bases were placed at Dover and Edinburgh.
          These locations led the Germans to believe that the invasion would come in the Pas De Calais region as it was the closest point between France and England or along the Norwegian coast. </p>

          <p>The fake sherman tanks were blowups like balloons and the planes were a wire mesh frame coverd in a sheet and painted. They also made fake heated radio communications about thing like winter equipment for the troops and tank fuel freezing
          which led the Germans to believe Norway was the target too.</p></td>
