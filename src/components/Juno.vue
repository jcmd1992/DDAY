          <p>Juno beach is the second beach from the east and it was invaded by the Canadian 3rd infantry division. Juno beach was 10km wide and and stretched on either side of the small fishing port of Courseulles-sur-Mer.
            Two smaller villages, Bernières and Saint-Aubin, lay to the east of Courseulles. Smaller coastal villages lay behind the sand dunes and had been fortified by the occupying Germans with casemates and adjacent fighting positions.
            The initial hazard for the invaders at Juno, however, was not the German obstacles but natural offshore reefs or shoals.The initial landing time was set for was set for 0745 hours, so that the landing craft could clear the reef on the rising tide.
          It was later discovered that the shoals were actually seaweed. The gGermans defending the area were elements of the 16th Infantry Division, particularly the 736th Regiment, who made use of the seafront houses which offered them excellent observation and firing positions. </p>

          <p>Juno beach was also assigned to the British 2nd army under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey.The objectives of the 3rd Division on D-Day were to cut the Caen-Bayeux road, seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen and form a link between the two British beaches of Gold
            and Sword on either side of Juno Beach. The first assault wave landed at 0755 hours, 10 minutes past the initial plan and fully three hours after the optimum rising tide. This delay presented the invading Canadians with a difficult situation. The beach obstacles were already
            partially submerged, and the engineers were unable to clear paths to the beach. The landing craft were therefore forced to feel their way in, and the mines took a heavy toll. Roughly 30 percent of the landing craft at Juno were destroyed or damaged. </p>

          <p>When the troops waded ashore, there was little fire at first—mainly because the German gun positions did not aim out to sea but were set to barage the coastlinen with gunfire. When the Canadian soldiers worked their way through the obstacles and came into the killing zones,
            the first wave took dreadful casualties. Company B of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles was cut down to one officer and 25 men as it moved to reach the seawall. In the assault teams, the chance of becoming a casualty in that first hour was almost 1 in 2. When mid-morning came, hard fighting
            had brought the town of Bernières into Canadian hands and later Saint-Aubin was occupied. The Canadians progress inland past the towns was good, and, as some armoured units arrived in later waves which briefly interdicted the Caen-Bayeux road. One Troop of the 1st Hussar tank regiment was
            the only unit of the entire Allied invasion to reach its final objective on D-Day.</p></td>

          <p>When evening came, the 3rd Division had linked up with the British 50th Division from Gold Beach to the west, but to the east the Canadians were unable to make contact with the British 3rd Division from Sword Beach which meant there was a gap of 3 km into which elements of the German 21st Panzer Division counterattacked.
            The Canadians suffered 1,200 casualties out of 21,400 troops who landed at Juno that day which resulted in a casualty ratio of 1 out of 18.</p></td>
