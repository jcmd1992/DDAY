          <p>The allies planned to drop troops on the right flank and the left flank of the 5 beaches. The Americans were dropped on the right flank right at the start of the Contetin Peninsula.
          The Americans dropped the 101st Airborne Division and the 82nd Airborne Division behind enemy lines 6 hours before the DDAY landings were ser to begin. The overall objectives of the troops were to
          secure the area around the right flank of Utah beach.</p>

          <p>There were a lot of problems with the drops. The biggest one was a lot of paratroopers were missing from the units. This occurred because the Germans had flooded a lot of area behind Utah which would
          of made it hard for the plans navigators to find the correct dropzone especially at night and this was made even harder because they came under heavy anti air fire from the ground. A lot of paratroopers were either lost from
          landing in the wrong place, shot and killed or drowned from landing in water with their gear and getting covered up by the parachute</p></td>

          <p>The main objectives of the Airborne troops were to secure the 4 causeways or roads that led away from Utah beach, to capture the towns of Saint-Côme-du-Mont and Sainte-Mère-Eglise, destroy the German artillery battery located at
            Saint-Martin-de-Varreville before the landings at Utah started at sunrise and capture bridges that crossed over the Merderet and the Douve rivers. Two bridges cross the Merderet river at La Fière and Chef-du-Pont while four bridges
          cross the Douve river and the Carentan Canal to the north of Carentan. The allies decided to destroy the bridges that crossed Douve and preserve the bridges over Merderet river.</p></td>

          <p>13,000 paratroopers were dropped on France, some of them 40 km from their dropzone, and despite an extremely high number of casualties which was more than 50% in the single night, American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne accomplished
            many of their objectives. 2,500 airborne paratroopers and soldiers were dead, injured or missing in action as a result of the airborne assault behind the Atlantic Wall fortress.  The Germans, disorganized by the American random drops, no longer
            knew where to intervene. They were unable to trace the exact outline of the positions and objectives of their opponent. Not mastering this information, they were not able to counter-attack in a coordinated and effective manner. The lack of German
            officers on D-Day in the Cotentin area weighted heavily in the balance, especially as General Falley was killed shortly before sunrise by paratroopers of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment.</p></td>
