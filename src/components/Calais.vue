        <p>Hitler had thought that the Pas De Calais region would be the place were the invasion happened because it was the closest point to England. This was aided by the fact that
        the British had set up fake bases in and around Dover to male it look like Pas De Calais was the destination for the invasion force. Pas De Calais region is 241 km away from Normandy and the
        real invasion plans.</p>

        <p>Hitler also moved units away from normandy in particular some tanks to the eastern front as Germany was at war with russia. Hitler also moved a division to scandanavia which the area of Norway,
          Sweden and Denmark due to another fake base near Edinburgh. Hitler without realising weakened the response to the beaches by pulling divisions from Normandy and help the allies. </p></td>

        <p>The allies did not pick Pas De Calais because it was the most heavily fortified section of the atlantic wall. The Atlantic wall is what the 2,414 km of German defenses was known as.
        It stetched from Norway all the way down to Spain. The allies also helped hitler think that the invasion was coming at Pas De Calais by stepping up air raids on the region and increasing
          the amount until D'Day had actually arrived.</p></td>

        <p>Through Hitler's misjudgements came the turning point of the war in europe and if the Germans had any clue as to where the real location was, the allied invasion might have never got off the beach.</p></td>
